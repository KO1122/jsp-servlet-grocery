# Grocery Store Website 

## About

This project is a simple grocery store app built using JSP, Servlets, and JDBC. It allows users to manage a list of food items with full CRUD functionality â€” users can add new items to their shopping cart, view all items, update existing ones, and delete items they no longer need. The app also includes a search bar that lets users quickly find specific food items by name. It follows the MVC architecture and connects to a database using JDBC. Additionally, the app includes basic error handling through a custom error page to deal with incorrect inputs.
